# 🔁 Frequency Divider-by-3 Circuit

This repository contains the design and simulation of a **Frequency Divider-by-3** digital circuit. The design is implemented using custom-built **D latches (1564s)** and **XOR gates (EXOR1564s)** based on **MOSFET Current Mode Logic** using the **Triple Tail Cell (TTC)** approach.

## 🛠️ Circuit Overview

- **D Latch (1564s)**: Implemented using **series gating** with **Triple Tail Cell current-mode logic**.
- **XOR Gate (EXOR1564s)**: Also built using the same logic style to ensure high speed and compact area.
- The circuit uses feedback and synchronization to divide input clock frequency by 3.
